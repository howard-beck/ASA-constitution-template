\section{TeX help -- remove me}
\subsection{Sectioning commands}
\verb|\section| has been repurposed to mean ``Article."
\\
\\
(Hopefully not too confusingly), \verb|\subsection| has been repurposed to mean ``Section," and \verb|\subsubsection| means ``Subsection."
\\
\\
All sectioning commands have been modified to be clickable.
\ref{justification}

\subsubsection{Justification}
\label{justification}
The motivation for this change is to make it more intuitive to type the document, as you would use sectioning commands as usual.
Another reason is that the Overleaf interface displays a file outline based on \verb|\section| and its relatives, so electing to createan \verb|\article| command and not touching \verb|\section| and \verb|\subsection| means the outline would not display.

\subsection{File System}
\verb|commands.tex| contains all the custom and redefined commands, along with almost all the package imports -- so as to not clutter this file.
\\\\
\verb|latexmkrc| contains information that tells the compiler to use Eastern time in determining the date.
\\\\
\verb|main.tex| is what you think it is.

\subsection{Referencing}
You can reference other sections with \verb|\ref| as usual.
It has been redefined to automatically display the full name of the section.
\\\\
For example, take a look at \ref{justification}.
